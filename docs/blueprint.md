- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to create a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFC107) as an analogous color, reminiscent of traditional Jewish symbolism
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for a sophisticated, elegant feel.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) paired with Playfair for readability and a modern touch.
- Use subtle, classic icons related to commerce, faith, and charity, where appropriate. Example: a coin for pricing.
- Ensure a responsive design with a clear content hierarchy, prioritizing user experience on both desktop and mobile devices, switching the order of elements to maintain visual order on small devices.
- Use very subtle animations, such as a gentle fade-in on page load or a subtle hover effect on the 'Continue to Checkout' button, to enhance interactivity without distracting from the core content.
